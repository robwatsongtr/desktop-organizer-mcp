# Claude Code Guidelines

## Implementation Standards

- **Granular implementation**: Only implement one testable thing at a time. 
    
- **Separation of concerns**: Maintain clear separation in both files and directories.

- **Clean code**: Keep code as clean as possible.

- **Short functions**: Keep methods/functions as short as possible.

- **Use classes**: Organize functionality with classes to reduce code duplication if possible.
